      <div>In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 rods and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (e.g., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:
      (A) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
      (B) A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto the next rod.
      (C) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
      </div>

      <div>
      Write a program to move the disks from the first rod to the last using Stacks.
      </div>

      <div>
      Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order. You should not make any assumptions about how the stack is implemented. The following are the only functions that should be used to write this program: push | pop | peek | isEmpty.
      </div>

      <h3>Trees & Graphs</h3>
      <div>
      Implement a function to check if a tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that no two leaf nodes differ in distance from the root by more than one.
      </div>
      <div>Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.</div>

      <div>Given a sorted (increasing order) array, write an algorithm to create a binary tree with minimal height.</div>

      <div>Given a binary search tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (i.e., if you have a tree with depth D, youâ€™ll have D linked lists).</div>
