    <h3>Technical/Logic questions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Problem: you have two jars, 50 red marbles, 50 blue marbles. you need to place all the marbles into the jars such that when you blindly pick one marble out of one jar, you maximize the chances that it will be red. (when picking, youâ€™ll first randomly pick a jar, and then randomly pick a marble out of that jar) you can arrange the marbles however you like, but each marble must be in a jar.</li>
      <li>You have three jars that are all mislabeled. one contains peanut butter jelly beans, another grape jelly jelly beans, and the third has a mix of both (not necessarily a 50/50 mix, could be a 1/99 mix or a 399/22 mix). how many jelly beans would you have to pull out, and out of which jars, to find out how to fix the labels on the jars?</li>
      <li>What is the most efficient way, memory-wise, to store 1 million phone numbers?</li>
      <li>How do you find the minimum number in a stack of unordered integers?</li>
      <li>You have 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed. you make 100 passes by the doors starting with the first door every time. the first time through you visit every door and toggle the door (if the door is closed, you open it, if its open, you close it). the second time you only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6). the third time, every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9), etc, until you only visit the 100th door. Question: what state are the doors in after the last pass? which are open which are closed?</li>
      <li>What is the difference between binary search and linear search? Is one always faster than the other? What are the advantages to one over the other?</li>
